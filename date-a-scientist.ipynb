This section outlines the key components of the project scope, inspired by the [University of Chicago’s Data Science Project Scoping Guide](https://datasciencepublicpolicy.org/our-work/tools-guides/data-science-project-scoping-guide/).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎯 1. Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Objective**: Explore the OKCupid dataset to uncover patterns in dating preferences and behaviors using machine learning and NLP techniques.\n",
    "- **Secondary Goals**:\n",
    "  - Identify which user attributes are most predictive of compatibility.\n",
    "  - Apply clustering to discover latent user segments.\n",
    "  - Build a supervised model to predict user traits or preferences based on profile text.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📊 2. Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Source**: `profiles.csv` from OKCupid (provided in starter files)\n",
    "- **Structure**: Each row represents a user profile with multiple features including:\n",
    "  - Demographics (age, sex, orientation, location)\n",
    "  - Lifestyle (diet, smoking, drinking, drugs)\n",
    "  - Essay responses (10 free-text fields)\n",

    "- **Assumptions**:\n",
    "  - Users are honest in their profiles\n",
    "  - Essay content reflects personality and preferences\n",
    "- **Constraints**:\n",
    "  - No access to actual match outcomes\n",
    "  - Limited metadata on user interactions\n",

    "\n",
    "Many users on OKCupid consider **Zodiac signs** important when evaluating compatibility. However, not all users provide their zodiac sign in their profile. This creates a gap in the matching process.\n",

    "## 🔍 Why This Problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `sign` column has missing values, making it a good candidate for imputation via ML.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧪 ML Techniques to Be Used\n",

    "  - Baseline: Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes\n",
    "  - Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, or fine-tuned transformer (if time permits)\n",
